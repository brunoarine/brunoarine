### Hi, I'm Bruno ðŸ‘‹

<img src="img/header.png">

Iâ€™m a problem solver, and I want to get serious about solving back-end and mobile development problems! I have 10 years of experience as Physicist (Radiometry Specialist), and during this time I have used Python extensively to test and develop analysis algorithms, and implement UX tools to help the laboratory team with their routine tasks. In my masters thesis, I used machine learning (SciPy and Scikit-learn) to improve peak detection rates of gamma-ray spectrometry systems. Now I want to expand my horizons.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on my Software Engineering certificate.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on development projects where I can solve problems and optimize solutions.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I draw a webcomic called [Nebulosa Bar](https://www.nebulosabar.com.br). Also, I like to photograph things, and lift heavy things.
