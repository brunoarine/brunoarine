### Hi, I'm Bruno 👋

<img src="img/header.png">

I'm a physicist by profession, a problem solver by nature, and crazy about software development.

I have ten years of experience as the lead physicist of a radiometry laboratory. During this time, I have used Python to test and develop new spectrum analysis algorithms, analyze environmental data, and implement UX tools in Qt to help my laboratory team with our routine tasks. In my master's thesis, I used machine learning tools (Scikit-learn) to improve peak detection on gamma-ray spectrometry systems. Currently, I'm enrolled in a software engineering course to formalize my knowledge on software development and specializing in Kotlin (Android).

Solving laboratory problems with code has always been my thing. Now, I want to expand my horizons.

- I'm currently working on my Software Engineering certificate 🎓
- I’m currently learning Kotlin 🌱
- I’m looking to collaborate on development projects where I can solve problems and optimize solutions 📈
- Pronouns: he/him ️🧔🏻
- Fun fact ⚡ I draw a webcomic called [Nebulosa Bar](https://www.nebulosabar.com.br). Also, I like to photograph things, and lift heavy things.
