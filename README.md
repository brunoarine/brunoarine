### Hi, I'm Bruno ðŸ‘‹

<img src="img/header.svg">

Iâ€™m a physicist and aspiring back-end/mobile developer. I have 10 years of experience as Radiometry Specialist, and during this time I have used Python extensively to develop and test analysis algorithms, and implement UX tools to help the laboratory team with their routine tasks. In my masters thesis, I used machine learning (SciPy and Scikit-learn) to improve peak detection rates of gamma-ray spectrometry systems. Now I want to expand my horizons and get into serious back-end and mobile development.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on my Software Engineering certificate.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin, Django, and Flask. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on development projects, either mobile or back-end.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
