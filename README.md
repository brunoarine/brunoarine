### Hi, I'm Bruno 👋

<img src="img/header.png">

I'm a physicist by profession, a problem solver by nature, and I want to get serious about back-end and mobile development.

I have 10 years of experience as a physicist (radiometry specialist), and during this time I have used Python extensively to test and develop analysis algorithms, and implement UX tools to help the laboratory team with their routine tasks. In my masters thesis, I used machine learning (SciPy and Scikit-learn) to improve peak detection rates of gamma-ray spectrometry systems. Solving problems with code at the lab has always been my thing. Now, I want to expand my horizons.

- I'm currently working on my Software Engineering certificate 🎓
- I’m currently learning Kotlin 🌱
- I’m looking to collaborate on development projects where I can solve problems and optimize solutions 👯
